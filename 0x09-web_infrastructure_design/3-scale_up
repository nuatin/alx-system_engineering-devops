Simplified Explanation:
Load Balancer (HAProxy):

The load balancer is like a traffic cop directing cars. It evenly distributes incoming traffic between the web server and application server, making sure no one gets overwhelmed.
Web Server:

The web server is like a waiter serving food. It handles requests for web pages, images, and other static content that users see in their browsers.
Application Server:

The application server is like a chef in the kitchen. It processes dynamic requests, runs the website's code, and interacts with the database to generate personalized responses.
Database Server:

The database server is like a storage room holding ingredients. It stores and manages data for the website, such as user accounts, product information, and other important data.
Specifics Explanation:
Why Load Balancer?:

We add a load balancer to evenly distribute incoming traffic between the web server and application server. This helps improve performance, scalability, and reliability by preventing overload on any single server.
Why Split Components?:

Splitting components into separate servers helps with organization, scalability, and fault isolation. It allows us to scale each component independently and troubleshoot issues without affecting other parts of the infrastructure.
In Summary:
The load balancer distributes traffic between the web server and application server.
The web server serves static content like web pages and images.
The application server processes dynamic requests and interacts with the database.
Splitting components into separate servers improves scalability and fault tolerance.
