Infrastructure Design:
•	User: A person who wants to access the website www.foobar.com.
•	Server: A single server hosting the entire web infrastructure.
•	Domain Name: foobar.com configured with a www record pointing to the server's IP address (e.g., 8.8.8.8).
•	DNS Record: The www record in www.foobar.com is a CNAME record pointing to the server's IP address.
•	Web Server: Nginx, responsible for handling HTTP requests and serving static content.
•	Application Server: Responsible for running the dynamic parts of the website, processing requests, and generating responses.
•	Application Files: The code base of the website hosted on the server.
•	Database: MySQL, storing data required by the web application.
Explanation of Specifics:
1.	What is a server?: A server is a computer system that serves requests from other computers, such as serving web pages, processing data, or running applications.
2.	Role of the domain name: The domain name (foobar.com) is like the address of the website on the internet, allowing users to access it using a memorable name instead of an IP address.
3.	Type of DNS record www in www.foobar.com: The www record in www.foobar.com is a CNAME (Canonical Name) record, which points to another domain name (in this case, foobar.com).
4.	Role of the web server: The web server (Nginx) handles incoming HTTP requests from users' browsers and serves static content like HTML, CSS, and images.
5.	Role of the application server: The application server runs the dynamic parts of the website, executing code, processing user inputs, and generating personalized responses.
6.	Role of the database: The database (MySQL) stores and manages the website's data, such as user accounts, posts, or product information.
7.	Communication between server and user's computer: The server communicates with the user's computer using HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) over the internet.
Issues with the Infrastructure:
1.	Single Point of Failure (SPOF): Since the entire infrastructure is hosted on a single server, any failure in the server hardware or software could lead to downtime for the entire website.
2.	Downtime during maintenance: When maintenance tasks like deploying new code require restarting the web server (Nginx), the website may experience downtime, causing inconvenience to users.
3.	Limited scalability: If the website experiences a sudden surge in incoming traffic, a single server may struggle to handle the load efficiently, leading to slow performance or even crashes.
By addressing these issues and considering scalability and redundancy, we could improve the reliability and performance of the web infrastructure. This might involve implementing load balancing, redundancy measures, and a more distributed architecture.
